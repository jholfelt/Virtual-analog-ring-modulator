# Virtual-analog-ring-modulator
This is a simple implementation of Julian Parker's simplified model of a diode ring modulator
The model is implemented as a real-time audio system toolbox model, as well as a MATLAB script.
This was implemented as a mini-project for the course Physical Modelling Sound Synthesis 8th semester of Sound and Music Computing Aalborg University Copenhagen.
